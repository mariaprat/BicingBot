# Telegram Bicing Bot üö≤

Bicing is a bicycle sharing system in Barcelona with stations distributed throughout the city that include many docks for bikes. This project consists of a Telegram bot that answers questions related to geometric graphs defined over Bicing stations. Some of the answers are given by plotting graphs over maps to easily visualize the output.
